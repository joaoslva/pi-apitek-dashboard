Done.

  The Pi stays a normal WiFi client whenever a known network is in range.
  When there is none, within about a minute it raises its own network:

      SSID:  $AP_SSID
      URL:   http://10.42.0.1/     (NetworkManager's shared-mode address)

  It switches back automatically when a known network reappears.

  To add another network later (a phone hotspot, a friend's WiFi), run on the Pi:
      sudo nmcli device wifi connect "<SSID>" password "<password>"
  and the fallback logic will pick it up with no further configuration.
